        <h1>Crème brûlée</h1>
        <p>
          This rich and creamy custard dessert is said to have originated in
          France in the 17th century. The name "crème brûlée" means "burnt
          cream" in French, and it refers to the caramelized sugar topping that
          is traditionally added to the dish.

            Here's a list of the ingredients you will need to make crème brûlée:
          </p>
          <li>1 cup (240ml) heavy cream</li>
          <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
          <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) vanilla extract</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon (1g) salt</li>
          <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) water</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="instructions">
        <ol>
          <h3>Instructions:</h3>
          <li>
            In a medium saucepan, heat the cream and sugar over medium heat
            until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a simmer. Remove
            from the heat and let cool slightly.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, vanilla extract,
            and salt. Gradually whisk in the warm cream mixture until well
            combined.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into four ramekins or
            ovenproof glasses. Divide the custard evenly between the ramekins.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the ramekins in a baking dish and pour enough hot water into
            the baking dish to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the custard is set around the edges
            but still slightly jiggly in the center.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the ramekins from the baking dish and let cool completely on
            a wire rack.
          </li>
          <li>
            To make the caramel topping, heat the sugar and water in a small
            saucepan over medium heat, swirling the pan occasionally, until the
            sugar melts and turns a deep amber color.
          </li>
          <li>
            Immediately pour the caramel evenly over the cooled custards. Let
            the caramel set completely before serving.
          </li>
          <li>
            To serve, run a small knife around the edges of each ramekin to
            loosen the custard, then invert the ramekins onto plates. Enjoy!
          </li>
